#Mentor Match


##Final Project for Codefellows Spring/Summer 2014
by Brian Studwell, Marco Lindsay and Tony Chung

This is a Ruby on Rails app that hopes to make a simple system for Code Fellows students and to connect with potential mentors.

##Final Project for CodeFellows Ruby on Rails Dev Accelator Fall 2014
by Phil Nguyen and Reed Nelson-Saunders

This a continuation of the hard work done by previous students Brian Studwell, Marco Lindsay and Tony Chung. Much of the backend was in place and the front end was beautifully styled.  Most of the work we did was wiring up the backend with the front end to achieve the intended functionality.  We also did cleaned up a lot of code that wasn't being used.

List of current features:

- Mentees can request a mentorship with a mentor and vice versa.
- Mentorship request recipients can accept or decline a request.
- Upon mentorship request acceptance an email is sent to both mentee and mentor with their contact info.
- Users can fill out a profile to let potential mentors/mentees about their background, tech-skills, etc.
- Users can end a mentorship.
- Users can browse and search for potential mentees or mentors.

List of issues and desired features:

- A message system for mentees to communicate with mentors.
- Fix some of the styling issues: approve/accept buttons on request notices in the dashboard should be stacked.
- An API for mobile or/and Angular front ends.
- Rename some classes to be consistent with the real world use of the app, e.g. Friendship model might be better named Mentorship.
- Add a favorites feature so users can create a list of potential mentors or mentees that they can look at later to make a final choice.
- Error with Faker gem data in a migration on Heroku.
